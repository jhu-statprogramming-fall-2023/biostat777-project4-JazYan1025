# About

## Column {data-width=350}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Purpose**

This dashboard was created to investigate how did the stock prices of five tech companies (Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft) change over time from 2010 to 2022.

### **Data source**

The original data come from [Yahoo Finance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56024713/how-to-use-gganimate-package-plot-a-dynamic-map-in-r), which provides historical stock data for various companies. The data was scraped and cleaned by [Ryo Nakagawara](https://anderfernandez.com/en/blog/how-to-create-animations-in-r-with-gganimate/) and posted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/big-tech-stock-prices/).

### **Author**

This dashboard was made by Yujia Yan.
